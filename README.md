*in progress

This application uses the spotify API to suggest playlists based on the users current emotion. For example, if someone is feeling happy, they would likely want to listen to a more upbeat playlist. Machine learning is applied both to understand the connection between emotion and music and to determine the user's emotional state based on facial recognition software. More details to come when completed.
